Pascalog
============

You may have gotten here via http://blog.yieldbot.com/introducing-pascalog but if you didn't that may give you more context around why this is even here. Go ahead, we'll wait.

Ok, so the Hamming Distance between "Cascalog" and "Pascalog" was just too short to pass up for a joke. Unlike Pascalog, Cascalog (http://www.cascalog.org) is the real deal and is an awesome technology developed by the folks at BackType (now Twitter) that we actually *do* use.

More Open Source
----------------

We actually *are* developing technology of our own that we'll be open sourcing soon. We'll be announcing it on our blog (http://blog.yieldbot.com), so keep an eye out for it there. Without getting into too much detail, if a new type of database that is easy to use, has a full built-in audit log, and lets you do things like view your data at specific points in the past, then you'll like what we'll be putting out there. No joke.
